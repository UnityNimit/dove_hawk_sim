## üî¨ How It Works

This project simulates the classic Hawk-Dove conflict model. Agents compete for a limited number of food resources. Their success determines their survival and reproduction.

*   **Population:** A mix of "Hawks" (aggressive strategy) and "Doves" (cooperative strategy).
*   **Resources:** Agents are randomly assigned to a set number of food resources.
*   **Encounters:**
    *   **One Agent:** If an agent is alone at a resource, it gets 2 food units and reproduces.
    *   **Two Agents:** If two agents arrive at the same resource, a conflict occurs based on the **Payoff Matrix**.

The simulation's default payoff matrix (where the value of the resource is 2 food units):

| Opponent ‚Üí <br> Player ‚Üì | Hawk (Aggressive) | Dove (Cooperative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hawk** | **0** food each <br> (Cost of fighting is high) | **2** food for Hawk <br> **0** for Dove |
| **Dove** | **0** food for Dove <br> **2** for Hawk | **1** food each <br> (They share the resource) |

*   **Survival & Reproduction:**
    *   **< 1 food:** The agent starves and is removed.
    *   **>= 1 food:** The agent survives to the next generation.
    *   **>= 2 food:** The agent survives *and* produces one offspring of the same type.

This simple set of rules leads to complex, emergent population dynamics, often stabilizing at a mixed equilibrium where both strategies coexist.

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's a new feature, a bug fix, or documentation improvements, please feel free to contribute.

1.  Fork the repository.
<!-- Formatting improvements for better readability -->
2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a **Pull Request**.

### Potential Future Improvements
*   Add spatial dynamics (agents on a grid).
*   Implement mutation (a hawk's offspring can be a dove, and vice-versa).
*   Add more complex strategies (e.g., "Retaliator" or "Bully").
